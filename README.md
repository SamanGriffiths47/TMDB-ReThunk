## Overview
****

This website was my first attempt at using React Router in conjuction with Redux and Thunk (hence, the name haha). I had a lot of fun revisiting the idea of querying the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) for information to display. I also tried to think a little bit outside of the box on the design, opting for a scrollable side menu from which users may choose a title.

### My Favorite Code Block:

My favorite code block is the component I used to record and display user ratings ([click here](https://github.com/SamanGriffiths47/TMDB-ReThunk/blob/master/src/components/movies/Rating.js) to see the whole thing), mainly because this was the feature I had the hardest time nailing down. I believe this was my first attempt at really saving state so that a user might leave a page they interacted with, come back, and the state would still reflect their changes. I had an especially tough time finding, cropping and styling the star images so that it actually looked somewhat professional. The functions in charge of the proper mouseover effects also challenged my patience and confidence as a software engineer.
